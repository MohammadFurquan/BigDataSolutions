# Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
# Ans:  Python is general purpose programming language because it is used to solve a wide variety of problems. Example – AI, ML, BIG DATA, WEB DEV and many more
# It is high-level programming language because it usages natural languages which is easily understandable 
# by human and it is usages mathematical notations which makes solution easy to understand by human beings.

# Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
# ANS: In Python Type check of variable takes place at run time not at declaration time so that execution become faster thats why 
#Python is called as dynamically typed language

# Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
# ANS: Pros of Python programming language
# 1.Easy to learn and read                        2.Python Enhance productivity

# 3.Python can have runtime errors # 
# 4.Python consumes a lots of memory space 
# 5.Python is not easy to test

# Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
# ANS: Python has a library either standard or third party for every thing, so technically you could say it's used for everything.
#• Machine learning / Artificial intelligence • Desktop GUI • Data analytics and data visualization • Web development • Game development • Mobile app development • Embedded systems …

# Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
# ANS: Variables are the name of memory allocated to store some values in python we can directly declare variable like a=10,a=5.55,a=True
# A Python variable is a symbolic name which reference or point an object In other way Python variable reserved memory location to store values.
# Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created when some value is assigned to it.

# Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
# Ans: We take input from user by simply using input function in our programme. We can also show message to user. It always take input as an string.

# Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
# ANS:  Default data type of input() method is string.

# Q8. What is type casting?
# ANS: Converting one data-type into another data-type is called type casting.

# Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
# ANS: Yes, we can take multiple input using input() by requesting user to enter delimited separated field. And then by using .split() method to separate delimited field.

# Q10. What are keywords?
# ANS: Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. There are 33 keywords in python.

# Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
# Ans: Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.

# Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
# ANS: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only. 
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
# By using print() function, Whatever inside parentheses will be printed on output of the console.

# Q14. What are operators in Python?
# ANS: In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. 
# The values that an operator acts on are called operands.

# Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
# ANS: ‘/’ is a division operator used to divide two integers and gives float data type While ‘//’ is a floor division operator which divide two integers 
# and gives int data-type it simply removes after decimal part.

# Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
# ```
# iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
# ```
# Code: 
a= 'iNeuron'
print(a*4)

# Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
# Code: 
num= int(input("Enter a number to check whether it is even or odd  : "))
if num%2==0:
    print(num,"is Even")
else:
    print(num,"is Odd")

# Q18. What are boolean operator?
# ANS: Boolean Operators is the type of operator which is  True and False these operators are used to check the conditions

# Q19. What will the output of the following?
# ```
# 1 or 0

# 0 and 0
# Ans: output for 1 or 0 will be 1
#     output for 0 and 0 will be 0

# True and False and True
#output will be False

# 1 or 0 or 0
# output will be 0



# Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
# Conditional statements are used in program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.
# Python has 3 key Conditional Statements
# I. If statement
# II. If else statement
# III. If elif ... elif else 


# Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
#ANS: 
# I. If is used to check the condition in program. If block executed only if condition is true
# II. If else statement -> if block executed if the condition is true Otherwise else block get executed for sure.
# III. If elif else -> One block from if or elif get executed if condition is true otherwise else block will get executed.



# Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
age=int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age>=18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")


# Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
# ```
# numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
# ```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for i in numbers:
    if i%2==0:
        sum=sum+i
print("The sum of all even numbers is : ",sum)


# Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
# ANS: 
a=int(input("Enter first Nnumber : "))
b=int(input("Enter second Nnumber : "))
c=int(input("Enter third Nnumber : "))
if a>b and a>c:
    print(a," is the greatest number")
elif b>a and b>c:
    print(b," is the greatest number")
else:
    print(c," is the greatest number")

# Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions
# ```
# numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
# ```


# - The number must be divisible by five
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
l=[]
for i in numbers:
    if i%5==0:
        l.append(i)

print(l)


# - If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
l=[]
for i in numbers:
    if i>150:
        continue
    l.append(i)
print(l)


# - If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
l=[]
for i in numbers:
    if i>500:
        break
    l.append(i)
print(l)
